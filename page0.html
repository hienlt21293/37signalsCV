<h1 style="font-family: 'stolf', monospace;">Hi, my name is Hien</h1>
<h2>and this is my <i>do-more-than-just-the-bare-minimum</i> application for 37signals SRE position.</h2>
<p>As you can tell, this site's design is heavily inspired by <a href = "https://omarchy.org/" target="_blank">Omarchy</a>.</p>

<p>Each "workspace" summarizes my working experience at a company or project. You can navigate between them using number keys (1, 2, 3, etc.) or the navigation bar at the top of the page.</p>

<p>The pop-up menu contains links to my resume and other stuff, inluding some fun projects I've worked on specifically to horn my skills for this application. You can open it by clicking the menu icon in the top left corner or pressing the backtick (`) or dot (.) key.</p>

<p>To go back to this page, simply press "w" or number 0.</p>
