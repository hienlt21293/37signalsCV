<h1>Hi, my name is Hien</h1>
<h2>and this is my <i>more-than-just-the-bare-minimum</i> application for the 37signals SRE position.</h2>

<p>
  As you can probably tell, this site’s design is heavily inspired by 
  <a href="https://omarchy.org/" target="_blank">Omarchy</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Each “workspace” summarizes my experience at a company or on a project.
  You can navigate between them using the number keys (1, 2, 3, etc.) or the navigation bar at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
  The pop-up menu contains links to my resume and other materials, including a few fun projects I built specifically to hone my skills for this application.
  You can open it by clicking the menu icon in the top-left corner or pressing the backtick (<code>`</code>) or dot (<code>.</code>) key.
</p>

<p>
  To return to this page, simply press <b>W</b> or the number <b>0</b>.
