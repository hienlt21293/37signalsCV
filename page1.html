<p><strong><em>About the company/project: </em></strong> HELLA is one of the world’s top 50 automotive suppliers, specializing in the development and production of lighting technologies and electronic components for vehicles.</p>
<p><strong><em>What I did:</em></strong> Developed <strong>embedded software in 
C/C++</strong> for Electronic Control Units (ECUs), 
focusing on features such as light control, keyless entry and key fob button functions. </p> 
<p><strong><em>Why I left: </em></strong>After two years, I realized my interests were more aligned with web technologies, so I decided to transition and began learning web development.</p>
<p><strong><em><b>What I remember most:</b> </em></strong> How to write efficient code. <br>In embedded systems, resources are limited, so I learned to optimize code for performance and memory usage.
<br>Although this role was not directly related to SRE, DevOps, or web development, it built a strong foundation in software engineering principles.<br><p>During this time, I gained a solid understanding of the 
<strong>software development lifecycle</strong>, <strong>version control</strong>, and effective <strong>cross-team collaboration</strong>.</p>
