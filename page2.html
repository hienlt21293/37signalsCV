<p><strong><em>About the company:</em></strong> KMS Technology is a global IT outsourcing firm based in the U.S., with development centers in Vietnam and Mexico that support clients across the U.S. and Canada.</p> <p><strong><em>What I did:</em></strong> Developed <strong>embedded software in C/C++</strong> for Electronic Control Units (ECUs), focusing on features such as light control, keyless entry, and key fob functionality.</p> <p><strong><em>Why I left:</em></strong> COVID-19. I got layed off </p> <p><strong><em>What I remember most:</em></strong><br> Although this role wasn’t directly related to SRE, DevOps, or web development, it gave me a strong foundation in core software engineering principles.<br> I gained practical experience with the <strong>software development lifecycle</strong>, <strong>version control</strong>, and <strong>cross-team collaboration</strong>.<br> Working in a resource-constrained environment also taught (or forced) me to write <strong>efficient, optimized code</strong> - balancing performance and memory usage effectively.</p>
<p><strong><em>What I did:</em></strong> Migrate legacy system to Azure. Set up, manage & monitor services running on Linux & Windows servers, SFTP server</p>
Set up CI/CD with Jenkins.

<p><strong><em><b>What I remember most:</b> </em></strong> How to write efficient code. In embedded systems, resources are limited, so I learned to optimize code for performance and memory usage.</p>
