<p><b><em>About the company:</em></b> HELLA is one of the world’s top 50 automotive suppliers, specializing in the development and production of advanced lighting technologies and electronic components for vehicles.</p>
<p><b><em>About the customer:</em></b> Sky Deutschland GmbH</p>
<p><b><em>What I did:</em></b> Developed <b>embedded software in C/C++</b> for Electronic Control Units (ECUs), focusing on features such as light control, keyless entry, and key fob functionality.</p> <p><b><em>Why I left:</em></b> I realized that embedded programming wasn’t the best fit for my interests or strengths. While I appreciated the technical challenges, I didn’t feel the same enthusiasm and motivation I was looking for in my work.</p> <p><b><em>What I remember most:</em></b><br> Although this role wasn’t directly related to SRE, DevOps, or web development, it gave me a strong foundation in core software engineering principles.<br> I gained practical experience with the <b>software development lifecycle</b>, <b>version control</b>, and <b>cross-team collaboration</b>.<br> Working in a resource-constrained environment also taught (or forced) me to write <b>efficient, optimized code</b> - balancing performance and memory usage effectively.</p>
