<p><strong><em>What I did:</em></strong> Developed embedded software in <strong>C/C++</strong> for Electronic Control Units (ECUs), focusing on features such as light control, keyless entry</strong> and <strong>key fob button functions</strong>. During this time, I gained a solid understanding of the <strong>software development lifecycle</strong>, <strong>version control</strong>, and effective <strong>cross-team collaboration</strong>.</p> <p>Although this role was not directly related to SRE, DevOps, or web development, it built a strong foundation in software engineering principles. <br><br>After two years, I realized my interests were more aligned with web technologies, so I decided to transition and began learning web development.</p>

<p><strong><em><b>What I remember most:</b> </em></strong> How to write efficient code. In embedded systems, resources are limited, so I learned to optimize code for performance and memory usage.</p>
