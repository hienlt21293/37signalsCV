    <br>- Implemented and managed CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, which automated deployments and reduced release cycles by <strong>XX%</strong>.
    <br>- Owned production incidents and monitoring, improving system reliability and achieving <strong>XX.X%</strong> uptime.
    <br>- Performed cost optimization initiatives that reduced monthly AWS bills by <strong>XX%</strong> without sacrificing performance.

  <b><em>What I remember most:</em></b><br>
  - As in any fast-paced startup environment, I learned to balance peed and reliability under tight delivery cycles.<br>
<i>- One particular incident that stands out:</i>
During peak hours, we experienced a severe performance degradation - the website became extremely slow despite scaling up and out our infrastructure. 
Upon reviewing metrics, I noticed that although our AWS OpenSearch cluster had many nodes, only one node showed abnormally high CPU utilization. 
Further analysis revealed that the cluster’s largest index had just one shard per node, causing uneven load distribution and high query latency. 
I reconfigured the index to use multiple shards and replicas, which evenly distributed traffic across nodes and restored normal performance within minutes. 
This incident reinforced the importance of understanding underlying architecture and staying calm and analytical during high-pressure situations.
