<p><strong><em>About the company:</em></strong> EPAM is a widely recognized as one of the best IT outsourcing companies.</p> 
<p><strong><em>About the project:</em></strong> SYNGENTA.</p> <p><strong><em>What I did:</em></strong> Developed <strong>embedded software in C/C++</strong> for Electronic Control Units (ECUs), focusing on features such as light control, keyless entry, and key fob functionality.</p> <p><strong><em>Why I left:</em></strong> There was a change in the company’s structure, and I no longer felt aligned with the project’s new direction.</p> <p><strong><em>What I remember most:</em></strong><br> Although this role wasn’t directly related to SRE, DevOps, or web development, it gave me a strong foundation in core software engineering principles.<br> I gained practical experience with the <strong>software development lifecycle</strong>, <strong>version control</strong>, and <strong>cross-team collaboration</strong>.<br> Working in a resource-constrained environment also taught (or forced) me to write <strong>efficient, optimized code</strong> - balancing performance and memory usage effectively.</p>
