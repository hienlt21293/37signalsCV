  <b><em>What I remember most:</em></b><br>
October 29, 2025 - Azure FrontDoor global outage. The service was completely down. Our web app was inaccessible. 
I applied a temporary workaround by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/networking/global-web-applications/mission-critical-content-delivery#approach" target="_blank">adding Azure Traffic Manager in front of FrontDoor</a> (for most solutions, Azure recommend the use either Front Door or Azure Traffic Manager, but not both). Our service availability was restored within 30 minutes, minimizing user impact. 
<br>I remember this the most because I had read the documentation about this architecture pattern. So when the incident happened, it was an "all the dots connected" moment for me.
