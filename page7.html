  <h2><i>What I did:</i></h2>
  <p>I was the sole DevOps engineer for the company, responsible for designing, building, and scaling their infrastructure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Architected and built new AWS infrastructure from scratch using Terraform, supporting <strong>20+</strong> microservices and <strong>XX</strong> users.</li>
    <li><b>Monorepo enablement:</b> Consolidated services into a single repository; established shared packages and versioning strategy for consistent releases.</li>
    <li><b>CI/CD (GitHub Actions):</b> Implemented a matrix strategy for parallel builds and deployments; added change detection to run only affected jobs, reducing CI cost and speeding feedback. Deployment time reduced by <strong>XX%</strong>.</li>
    <li><b>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) at scale:</b> Structured Terraform folders with clear environments/modules layout and Terragrunt orchestration; authored reusable modules and leveraged public modules for efficiency.</li>
    <li><b>Observability:</b> Deployed Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, Tempo with OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics/logs/traces correlation. Version-controlled dashboards via Git; integrated Grafana alerting with Slack. Improved incident detection by <strong>XX%</strong>.</li>
    <li><b>ECS at scale:</b> Standardized Fargate services with monitoring enabled; implemented circuit breakers, auto-rollback, ALB integration, and metrics-driven autoscaling. Enabled internal service discovery and consistent labeling for SLOs.</li>
    <li><b>Network design:</b> Designed non-overlapping CIDR VPCs, isolated workloads in private subnets, managed cross-VPC connectivity via VPC peering. Hardened ingress/egress rules, enforced IAM least privilege, MFA, and secure remote access with AWS Client VPN.</li>
    <li>Prepared comprehensive handover documentation and conducted knowledge transfer sessions to ensure smooth transition and ongoing maintenance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><i>What I remember most:</i></h2>
  <p>
    This role was extremely hands-on and gave me full ownership of the platform. I especially remember the challenge of scaling ECS services with proper monitoring and implementing observability pipelines. Seeing the system stabilize under load after restructuring CI/CD, network, and IaC workflows was highly rewarding and reinforced the importance of automation, reliability, and maintainable architecture.
