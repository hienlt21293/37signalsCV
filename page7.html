<p><b><em>About the company:</em></b> Cinch is Asia's leading Device-as-a-Service (DaaS) platform, offering consumers and businesses flexible, subscription-based access to electronics like phones and laptops.</p> <p><b><em>What I did:</em></b> Developed <b>embedded software in C/C++</b> for Electronic Control Units (ECUs), focusing on features such as light control, keyless entry, and key fob functionality.</p>
<p><b><em>What I remember most:</em></b><br> Although this role wasn’t directly related to SRE, DevOps, or web development, it gave me a strong foundation in core software engineering principles.<br> I gained practical experience with the <b>software development lifecycle</b>, <b>version control</b>, and <b>cross-team collaboration</b>.<br> Working in a resource-constrained environment also taught (or forced) me to write <b>efficient, optimized code</b> - balancing performance and memory usage effectively.</p>
